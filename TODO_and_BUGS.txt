TODO

1. Materials - Use other exported properties (mirror, darkness, etc...)
2. Toggle controls for per-fragment lighting, shadow casting, etc.
3. Shadow casting
4. Get some tasks on alternate threads - Look up Web Workers (one page bookmarked in JS reference folder)
5. Test all browsers
6. Fix ParticleForceGenerator Buoancy to take actual submerged volume into account.
7. 3D local rotations
8. Spatial partitioning.

BUGS

1. Multiple light sources of the same type - Build this in. This might be finite, as individual lights may require hard-coding.
2. Objects with many textures - Test how to ensure the right textures end up in the right place.
3. Particle re-ordering no longer seems to be working. It once was... what the hell happened?
