TODO

1. Materials - Use other exported properties
2. Animations - Investigate how much of a nightmare they may be to export and implement.
3. Mouse input
4. Performance info/control - Build temporary html display fields outside of canvas to display pertinant performance info and provide
   toggle controls for per-fragment lighting, shadow casting, etc.
5. Provide simple control for offsetting an object's centre of mass/rotation.
	Set up scene graph - better management of matrices... pertinent to my setup? I think I more-or-;ess have this now?
6. Shadow casting
7. Get some tasks on alternate threads - Look up Web Workers (one page bookmarked in JS reference folder)
8. Get this thing online, and test all browsers
9. a) Fix ParticleForceGenerators.Buoancy to take actual submerged volume into account.
10. Use this for trajectory around Tornado shape:
	x = tcos(t)
	y = t
	z = tsin(t)

BUGS

1. Multiple light sources of the same type - Build this in. This might be finite, as individual lights may require hard-coding.
2. Objects with many textures - Test how to ensure the right textures end up in the right place.
3. Fix rotation matrices and camera. (Learn quaternions)
4. Continue Fireworks sample
5. Unless a very good reason for not doing this approaches, make the Particle Force Generators/Registration a part of the ParticlePhysics prototype for each particle
